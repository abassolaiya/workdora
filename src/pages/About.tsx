          <h1>About Workdora</h1>
          <p>
            One intelligent platform that eliminates tool overload, bringing
            AI-native productivity directly into your workspace.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div className="story-text">
          <p>
            Workdora was born out of frustration with endless apps, constant
            context switching, and wasted energy. Teams were spending more time
            juggling tools than doing actual work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2025, we reimagined productivity from the ground up: What if AI
            could live natively in your workspace, unifying tasks,
            communication, and knowledge into one flow?
          </p>
          <p>
            Thatâ€™s the Workdora visionâ€”fewer apps, fewer distractions, more
            focus. Our mission is to empower teams to achieve more with less
            effort by making productivity simple, intelligent, and human.
